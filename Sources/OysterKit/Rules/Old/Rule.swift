     Should perform the actual check and manage the communicaion with the supplied `IntermedidateRepresentation`. If the match fails, and that failure cannot
     be ignored an `Error` should be thrown. It is the responsiblity of the implementer to ensure the following basic pattern is followed
     
        1. `ir.willEvaluate()` is called to inform the `ir` that evaluation is beginning. If the `ir` returns an existing match result that should be used (proceed to step XXX)
        2. `lexer.mark()` should be called so that an accurate `LexicalContext` can be generated.
        3. Perform apply your rule using `lexer`.
        4. Depending on the outcome, and the to-be-generated token:
            - If the rule was satisfied, return a `MatchResult.success` together with a generated `lexer.proceed()` generated context
            - If the rule was satisfied, but the result should be consumed (no node/token created, but scanning should proceed after the match) return `MatchResult.consume` with a generated `lexer.proceed()` context
            - If the rule was _not_ satisfied but the failure can be ignored return `MatchResult.ignoreFailure`. Depending on your grammar you *may* want to leave the scanner in the same position in which case issue a `lexer.proceed()` but discard the result. Otherwise issue a `lexer.rewind()`.
            - If the rule was _not_ satisfied but the failure should not be ignored. Call `lexer.rewind()` and return a `MatchResult.failure`
            - If the rule was _not_ satisifed and parsing of this branch of the grammar should stop immediately throw an `Error`
     
    For standard implementations of rules that should satisfy almost every grammar see `ParserRule` and `ScannerRule`. `ParserRule` has a custom case which
     provides all of the logic above with the exception of actual matching which is a lot simpler, and it is recommended that you use that if you wish to provide your own rules.
